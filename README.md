# SDK Pipeline aka SDK as a Function

This repository explores a way to create an Adobe Experience Edge SDK as a series of plugins. In a nutshell we build a
pipeline of plugins that are invoked one after the other. This is by no means a new idea. There are at least three
different projects that use this approach:
- Ktor
- AWS JavaScript SDK v3
- Azure Java SDK
